# minecraft-lists

This repository aims to act as a list of items and blocks in each release of Minecraft.

## Methodology

Although there may be a less tedious method, I currently just scroll through the list of items prefilled in the `/give` and `/setblock` commands. This ensures accurate data. Make a pull request if you have any other useful ID lists for old versions, new versions, or things like entities or particles that aren't currently tracked here.
